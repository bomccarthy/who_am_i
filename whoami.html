<h1>William J. "Bo" McCarthy III</h1>
<h2>My Coding Life</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Bo and I am excited to be a programmer. At the moment, I am working toward finishing a coding boot camp through <a href="https://codingtemple.com/">Coding Temple</a>. The reason I want to learn coding is because I enjoy problem solving and building things. I want to persue a pathway that will allow me to use my creativity and logical thinking to build tools to make life easier for everyone. I've been coding HTML for fun since the late 1990's and you can view my "<a href="https://rockhound1.tripod.com/">Social Media</a>" page from a time when there was no such thing as social media. For the last 17 years, I have been in the oil industry pursuing a career as an exploration geologist and have successfully found and drilled oil in the Permian Basin. Most of my career has been with small oil companies for which I was the "IT" guy because I worked with computers and networks as a hobby.</p>
